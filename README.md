# Random-Warp-Tracker
This code tracks your path through a random warp mod  for you to backtrace and find the shortest path between two nodes. This is breadth first search since most nodes are never that deep. However, the algorithm can be easily modified if you are facing some sort of a perverse map spawn or bad random seed

Remembering the warps can be very difficult and this is useful to complete all tasks in order
