# Random-Warp-Tracker
This code tracks your path through a random warp mod  for you to backtrace and find the shortest path between two nodes. This is breadth first search since most nodes are never that deep. However, the algorithm can be easily modified if you are facing some sort of a perverse map spawn or bad random seed and you want to go depth first say.

Potential future updates:
1) Adding two or more graphs together from different seeds or mods
2) One way warp warnings before going inside a zone and alternative paths (although it was sort of done here if you write warnings while describing the path taken)

Remembering the warps can be very difficult and this is useful to complete all tasks in order
